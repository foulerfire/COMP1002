<!-- Construct a properly structured HTML document, including a proper DOCTYPE, character-encoding META tag, and a lang attribute on the HTML start tag.
Structure the page with appropriate page-level sectioning elements (header, main and footer) to construct the main document outline.
Think of the various pieces of information that you’d need to collect from someone to deliver them a pizza. This might include the following:
Number of pizzas
Size (number of slices)
Shape (square or round)
Toppings
Deep dish, thin crust or some other crust types
Take out, delivery, or eat-in g. And so on…
Build a FORM that would allow a visitor to order their pizza(s), including a variety of form controls such as:
labels
fieldsets/legends
text boxes
select menus
radio buttons
checkboxes
text areas
submit/reset buttons
…and any others that you feel make sense.
As you are building out your page, be sure to make regular commits with comments that document your progress toward completion - this part is very important. Push each commit up to your remote repository on GitHub.
Include at least one <img /> element to insert a relevant illustration or photograph inside a paragraph in the page with an alt attribute. Ensure that the type of file is appropriate to the image (.jpg for a photograph, .png or .gif for an illustration/graphic).
Include helpful HTML comments to make the code more friendly and easy to maintain. Ensure that your code is also formatted appropriately.
Commit any and all changes to your local Git repository, then push the changes up to your remote repository on GitHub.
Have fun.  


TAKE IT FURTHER



Consider some more specific FORM elements like:
phone
email
numerical input
date
option groups
color
range
meter
progress
Capture some of the user form input and output it to another page to confirm the user’s order using a server-side script like PHP (you will need to use GitHub Pages for this as we did in Lesson 4 - see the lesson recording for how to set this up).
Anything else you can think of…-->
