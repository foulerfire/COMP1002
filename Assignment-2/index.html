            <h2>About the Movie</h2>
            <p> In <em>Swiss Army Man</em> Hank Thompson, marooned and suicidal on a remote island, discovers a flatulent corpse that washes ashore. The corpse’s nonstop farts first confuse Hank, then allow him to ride it like a jet ski across the ocean to the mainland. The body also produces an endless supply of drinkable water when filled with runoff and gradually comes to life, learning to speak and naming itself Manny.

            <p>With no memory of his past, the innocent and uninhibited Manny follows Hank’s lead. Hank builds crude props from plants and trash to simulate civilization, teaching Manny about restaurants, movies, and parties. He invents a fantasy woman named Sarah (a real married woman Hank has secretly stalked and photographed from afar) and convinces Manny that he’s in love with her, using Manny himself as a living compass that always points them toward “her.”
            Hank impersonates Sarah to coach Manny on romance, but the role-play ends with the two men kissing. When Hank confesses the deception, Manny feels betrayed and wishes to be fully dead again.</p> 
            <p>Despite the rift, Manny later saves Hank from a bear by igniting a massive fart-flame from their campfire and carries the injured Hank straight to Sarah’s actual house—revealing they were never far from civilization.
            At Sarah’s home, Manny terrifies her young daughter by demonstrating his bizarre powers. Police arrive, find Hank’s obsessive photos of Sarah, and take him into custody. In the chaos, Hank’s father briefly mistakes the corpse for his son, and Hank rants on live TV about Manny’s magic before fleeing with the body. </p> 
            <p>Pursued to the beach by police, Sarah’s family, reporters, and his father, a cornered Hank lets out a long, defeated fart. As officers arrest him, Manny suddenly reanimates one final time, unleashing a torrent of flatulence that propels him across the ocean like a speedboat. Manny and Hank share one last smile as the corpse rockets away and vanishes over the horizon.</p>
