<!-- The CSS Movie Poster
DESCRIPTION
On your own, select an interesting movie poster that contains a reasonable amount of textual content (at least a few paragraphs, some headings, some quotes, or other text-based content). Decide how you might assign a variety of HTML elements to the content, then build out a web version of the page. 
 
INSTRUCTIONS

Pick an interesting movie poster (with enough image resolution to make out all the text). 
Type out all of the textual copy from the poster into a code editor. 
Mark up each part of the resulting document with a variety of HTML sectioning and phrasing elements. 
Include a few useful hyperlinks to the official movie web site and/or some reviews.
Add some interesting images to the page to make the poster look more convincing.
Include some inline, embedded, or external CSS rules to visually control a variety of aspects of the page text (colour, font-family, font-size, alignment, line-height, line-height, etc.). Do your best to approximate the appearance of the original text of the movie poster you selected for the assignment - it does not need to look exactly the same.
Validate the resulting HTML document (proceed to http://validator.w3.org).
Upload your HTML page and any images to your Web server and determine the URL to view the result.
